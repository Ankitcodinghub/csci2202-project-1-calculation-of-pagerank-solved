This project guides you through the calculation of PageRank, the algorithm used by Google to rank search queries. The two graph files provided alongside this document (tiny.txt, medium.txt) represent two graphs of web-pages.

You will implement a model of search on the graph, the random crawler model, to compute the PageRank . You will do this in two ways: (i) By simulating the behaviour of a random crawler on the graph and (ii) By implementing a Markov Chain computation.

Each ‚Äúpage‚Äù on the web has links that can be followed to another page.

‚Ä¢ 90% of the time, the crawler moves to another ‚Äúpage‚Äù by picking a link uniformly at random (with equal probability) from the current page and follows it.

‚Ä¢10% of the time, the crawler picks a random page from the entire web and jumps to it. (Google originally used the values: 85% and 15% respectively, when PageRank was first introduced).

To complete the PageRank calculations, follow the steps laid out below:

(1) You will need to read in one of the graph files provided (tiny.txt, medium.txt) as an adjacency matrix.

For this, create a function adjMatrixFromFile( fileName ). The function returns an adjacency matrix of the graph. The input graph files are given as a series of numbers, formatted in the following way:

(a) The first line of the file contains a single integer, N. This value represents the number of nodes (ƒ±.e. web-pages) this graph contains. Store this value. It will be important when creating a properly sized matrix.

(b) The file contains N more lines, one for each node in the graph. The lines have sets of integer pairs. Each integer pair (a, b) represents an edge in the graph, where there is an edge going from node a to node b. The node values will be in the range [0, N-1]. It is possible for the exact same pair to appear more than once.

An adjacency matrix is a square matrix containing values that show the distribution of edges within a graph. The adjacency matrix has dimensions N √óN. Each (row, column) entry: a(i,j) of the matrix contains the number of edges going i ‚Üí j. For example, location (1, 2) in the adjacency matrix generated from tiny.txt is 2, as the pair 1 2 occurs twice in the graph.

(2) Next, create a function outDegrees(adjacencyMatrix) to generate an array of the out-degree of each node. The out-degree of a node is the number of edges which leave that node (i.e. the number of out-links in a web-page). This function accepts a single parameter, adjacencyMatrix, which is an N √ó N NumPy matrix. The out-degree of a node i is equal to the sum of its row in an adjacency matrix. Create a N x 1 array (recall the dimensions of a matrix: row √ó column) which stores the out-degree of each node in the input graph. Return the array of out-degrees.

(3) Create a function transitionProbabilities( adjacencyMatrix, outDegrees) to generate and return the transitionMatrix. This in an N √óN matrix with entries pi,j ‚Äì which is the probability of the crawler moving: i ‚Üí j defined as:

pi,j = 0.90 √ó Ai,j/Oi + 0.10/N

where A is the (N √ó N) adjacency matrix and O the (N) array of outdegrees. Compute and return the p matrix. Now you can proceed with computing the PageRank of each page in the graph:

I. PageRank by Simulation:

Using the functions you have implemented above, write a program randomCrawler.py. The program should take an integer numTrials, input by the user. The simulation starts the crawler at web-page 0. The crawler makes random transitions to other pages, keeping count of the number of times it visits each page.

Suppose the crawler is on page k. The transition probabilities from page k to every other page in the graph is given by the elements of the kth row of the p (transition matrix).

To compute the page the crawler lands on:

‚Ä¢ Pick a random number: 0 ‚â§ r &lt; 1.

‚Ä¢ Sum the probabilities till Xp[k][j] &gt;= r.

‚Ä¢ The crawler makes a transition to page j.

‚Ä¢ Increment the count of visits to page j.

Repeat the above steps numTrials times. The elements of the count of visits array divided by numTrials, gives an approximation to the PageRank for each page in the graph.

II. PageRank using the Power Method:

For this part, do the familiar Markov Chain calculation:

‚Ä¢ Start with an initial vector x0 = [1,0,0‚Ä¶0]T

(the superscript T indicates transpose). x0 is a column vector (N √ó 1 array).

‚Ä¢ Carry out the computations: xk+1 = pT xk for k = 0,1‚Ä¶ numTrials.

‚Ä¢ The final array xnumTrials is the PageRank.

Problems:

(1) Test your programs using tiny.txt with numTrials = 100. The output is provided alongside this document.

(2) Repeat for numTrials = 100000. Make properly labelled histograms of the PageRanks for tiny.txt &amp; medium.txt, for each of the above two methods.

(3) Modify the graphs to ignore the effects of multiple links. That is, if there are multiple links from a page to another, count them as a single link. Do this with tiny.txt and medium.txt. Use the new transition matrix, compute the modified PageRank vector using the Power Method only. Include the histograms and comment on the changes you notice.

(4) Finally, modify the file: medium.txt to add links to page 23 from every other page. Give the modified file a different name and save it. Run the Markov Chain calculation and make a properly labelled histogram of the PageRanks for the graph.

Note: Ideally, you will use a Jupyter notebook to present this project. You have used Jupyter notebooks in earlier labs. A reference for getting started with Jupyter notebooks is found at:
